I'm a PhD candidate in the UC Davis Ecology graduate program and the [Safford lab](https://saffordlab.wordpress.com/) studying the influence of disturbance on wildlife habitat. My dissertation research focuses on habitat use of birds and bats in previously burned forests of the Sierra Nevada range in California.  I'm interested in how species use forests burning at various levels of severity, how this varies spatially in a heterogeneous landscape, and how these relationships change through successional time.  Previous research includes investigations into the influence of fire suppression on patterns of burn severity in California forests, the impact of vineyard development on bird communities in the Colchagua Valley, Chile, and vulnerability of sensitive species to climate change in the Willamette Valley, Oregon.
