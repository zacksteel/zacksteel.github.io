I'm a PhD candidate in the UC Davis Ecology graduate program and the [Safford lab](https://saffordlab.wordpress.com/) studying the influence of disturbance on wildlife habitat. My dissertation research focuses on how wildfire alters landscape pattern and habitat use of birds and bats in California's Sierra Nevada forests.  Specifically, I'm interested in how species use forests burning at various levels of severity, how this varies spatially in a heterogeneous landscape, and how these relationships change through successional time.  Previous research includes investigations into the influence of fire history on patterns of burn severity in California forests, the impact of vineyard development on bird communities in the Colchagua Valley, Chile, and vulnerability of sensitive species to climate change in the Willamette Valley, Oregon.
